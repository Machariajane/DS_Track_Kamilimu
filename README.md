From the boxplot and barplot,the year 2015 stands out in terms of very high upper scores and fewer low scores  
This is consistent with the high leakage results seen in 2016  
  
The year 2016,saw the significant change from 2015.The high grades are fewer ,and we have more low scores  
The year 2016 had tighter rules on exam cheating and there was a change of leadership in the ministry of education which came with more stringent rules on national exams rollout
