For the high grades:A,A-,B+,B,B-,C+ there is a significnat difference between the male and female students.The male students in this grades are observably higher than the female students .

From C to E ,the grades equalize our between the sexes

The highest grade (A) and the lowest grade (E) have the least numbe of people


No. of All students sitting for their exams increased thoughout the years from 2006 to 2016

No. of FEMALE students increased through the years ,but between 2016 snd 2017the number reduced by 3575

No. of MALLE students increased also but between 2015 and 2016 the number reduced by 6494



There is a sharp change in the high grades between 2011 and 2015.
